//Calculating the are of the triangles

// First Case

const triangleOneBase = 10;
const triangleOneHeight = 13;
const triangleOneArea = ( (triangleOneBase * triangleOneHeight) / 2)
console.log(triangleOneArea);

const triangleTwoBase = 16.5;
const triangleTwoHeight = 20.3;
const triangleTwoArea = ( (triangleTwoBase * triangleTwoHeight) / 2);
console.log(triangleTwoArea);

// Which means Triangle one has an area of 65 meanwhile triangle two
//has an area of 167.475 so triangle two is way bigger.

// Second case

const triangleThreeBase = 16.5;
const triangleThreeHeight = 20.3;
const triangleThreeArea = ( (triangleThreeBase * triangleThreeHeight) / 2);
console.log(triangleThreeArea);

const triangleFourBase = 20.3;
const triangleFourHeight = 16.5;
const triangleFourArea = ( (triangleFourBase * triangleFourHeight) / 2);
console.log(triangleFourArea);

// Triangle Three & Four has the exact same area

const triangleFiveBase = 7.8;
const triangleFiveHeight = 5.6;
const triangleFiveArea = ( (triangleFiveBase * triangleFiveHeight) / 2);
console.log(triangleFiveArea);

const triangleSixBase = 9.3;
const triangleSixHeight = 12.4;
const triangleSixArea = ( (triangleSixBase * triangleSixHeight) / 2);
console.log(triangleSixArea);


// So Triangle five has an area of 21.84
// Triangle six has an area of ~ 57.66 which means triangle six is bigger.



// The question:

// We use parentheses to let JS know which order we want things to be
//calculated. If we don't specify with parentheses it will calculate it wrong.
